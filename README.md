## Project: Train a Smartcab How to Drive

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** with the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
) library installed

### Code

The final code is in the `smartcab/agent.py` python file. There are other files with similar names in that folder. The `agent_original.py` file is the original template file. The `agent_basic.py` is the basic agent, and the `agent_default.py` is the default agent. I didn't initialize a repository until the very end so there was no version control there. I decided not to delete them as they answer some of the earlier questions in the project.

I was not supposed to modify `smartcab/environment.py`, but I extended a little bit of its functionality (just the naming of the log files). The original functionality and interface still stays, no changes there.

The final report is in report.html

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `smartcab/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```python smartcab/agent.py```  
```python -m smartcab.agent```

This will run the `agent.py` file and execute the agent code.
